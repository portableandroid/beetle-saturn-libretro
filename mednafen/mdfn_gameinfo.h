/* The MDFNGI "game info" struct and the MDFNGameInfo global.

   Factored out of git.h so it can be included from plain C
   translation units. git.h itself is C++ (it pulls in <algorithm>,
   <string>, <vector>, <map>), but the MDFNGI typedef is pure POD and
   several C files now need it -- e.g. smpc_iodevice.c, where the gun
   device reads MDFNGameInfo's nominal_width and mouse_* fields when
   drawing crosshairs. git.h #includes this header in place of its
   former inline copy, so the C++ side sees the identical type. */
