/*
   The Video CD Card (a.k.a. MPEG card / Movie Card) is NOT a
   cartridge-slot device -- it does not live on the A-bus, and so it is
   deliberately not modelled as a CartInfo.  It plugs into the dedicated
   MPEG expansion connector and hangs off three buses:

     1) The CD block (SH-1).  All host-visible control happens through
        CD block commands 0x90-0xAF, plus AUTH_DEVICE/GET_AUTH with
        CR2 == 1.  MPEG sector data is routed to the card by the CD
        block's filter/partition machinery.
     2) VDP2.  Decoded frames are presented as the external background
        (EXBGEN in the VDP2 EXTEN register) and composited with normal
        priority/colour-calculation.
     3) SCSP.  Decoded MPEG audio is mixed into the analogue output
        path.

   mpeg.c models (1) in full and holds the state (2) and (3) consume;
   vdp2_render.c and cdb.c are the consumers.  All three codec layers
   come from libretro-common: rmpeg1_ps demultiplexes the Program
   Stream, rmpeg1_video decodes the MPEG-1 video elementary stream, and
   rmp3 decodes the MPEG-1 Layer II audio elementary stream.  Nothing
   about MPEG lives in this core beyond the glue.
