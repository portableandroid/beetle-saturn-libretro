/* ss_state.h:  cross-TU declarations for the save-state and
**              backup-RAM/cart-NV I/O entry points whose bodies
**              live in ss.c.  The eight SS_{Save,Load,Backup}*
**              functions are presently only called from inside
**              ss.c -- they were promoted to TU-external linkage
**              during the original C++ -> C migration (when they
**              lived in a separate ss_state.c TU) and the ss_state.c
**              TU has since been merged back into ss.c.  The
**              decls remain because the ninth symbol declared
**              here -- LibRetro_StateAction -- is consumed cross-
**              TU by mednafen/state.c and scu.h's state-action
**              dispatcher; the rest are grouped alongside it for
**              cohesion.  BRAM_Init_Data is the BackupRAM "fresh
**              format" prefix that ss.c stamps at boot and
**              restores on a failed save-file read.
